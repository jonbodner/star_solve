star_solve
==========

A simple brute-force solver for 6-pointed Magic Stars.

Probably interesting for the channel-based recursive permutation calculator in go, complete with caching support.
I plan to break that code into its own project eventually.

The code is currently hard-coded to cache all permutations < 10.  This number was arrived at experimentally.
